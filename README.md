### Problem Statement
**Uber has a constant imbalance in the demand and supply of rides which promotes poor customer retention**. To achieve a balance and ensure there is a  sufficient supply of rides to match the demand of customers, we will identify peak hours of the day in the most occurring start locations. This will help to know the locations to dispatch more riders to and what hours to do so. Customer satisfaction and customer retention will increase in such areas, and once this is achieved, it'll mean more profit for Uber.

### Project Description
The aim of this project is to carryout an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Uber trips dataset from New York to derive insights and patterns on which day(s) have the highest and the lowest trips or the busiest hour.  New York has a highly complex transportation system coupled with a large residential populace.
